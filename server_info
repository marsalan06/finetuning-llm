Training Math with 97,567 datapoints:
Batch Configuration:
Batch size: 4
Gradient accumulation: 8
Effective batch size: 4 × 8 = 32
Steps per Epoch:
Steps: 97,567 ÷ 32 = 3,049 steps/epoch
Total Training Steps:
Epochs: 3
Total steps: 3,049 × 3 = 9,147 steps
Checkpoint Frequency:
Save every: 500 steps
Checkpoints per epoch: 3,049 ÷ 500 = 6 checkpoints/epoch
Total checkpoints: 9,147 ÷ 500 = 18 checkpoints (keeps latest 3)
Evaluation Frequency:
Eval every: 500 steps
Evaluations per epoch: 6 evaluations/epoch
Training time estimate: ~2-4 hours on MacBook GPU depending on model size and system performance.
